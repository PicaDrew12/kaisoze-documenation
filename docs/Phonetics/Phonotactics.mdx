# Phonotactics of Kaisoze

The phonotactic rules of **Kaisoze** are highly restrictive, which gives the language a clean and consistent phonological profile. This section outlines the permitted syllable structures, consonant clusters, diphthongs, and rules governing word boundaries.

---

## 1. Syllable Structure

The default syllable structure in Kaisoze is <Tooltip word="CV">CV</Tooltip>—a consonant followed by a vowel. This structure is prevalent across nearly all words in the language and forms the phonological backbone of Kaisoze.

However, two types of deviations from the basic CV pattern are permitted:

### 1.1 VCV Structures
Words are allowed to begin with a vowel, provided that it is immediately followed by a consonant to preserve the CV rhythm overall. This results in an initial **VCV** structure.

> **Example**: *arami*, *eheni*

### 1.2 Consonant Clusters at Word Start

Only two specific <Tooltip word="Consonant Cluster">consonant clusters</Tooltip> are allowed at the **beginning** of a word:

- **tr** (as in *troko*)
- **kr** (as in *krano*)

No other clusters are allowed elsewhere in words.

> ✅ *krano*, *troja*  
> ❌ *trakno*, *naktr*

---

## 2. Diphthongs

Kaisoze permits a limited set of <Tooltip word="Diphthong">diphthongs</Tooltip>, which can substitute any vowel in the CV structure. These diphthongs may appear in **any position** within a word.

### Allowed Diphthongs

- **ai** (e.g. *kai*)
- **ei** (e.g. *kein*)
- **ia** (e.g. *liam*)
- **ui** (e.g. *tui*)

> **Examples**: *kaia*, *truia*, *meila*

---

## 3. Word Boundaries

Kaisoze imposes additional constraints on how words can begin and end, to reinforce phonotactic consistency.

### 3.1 Word-Initial Rules

Words may begin with either a vowel or a consonant. If a word begins with a vowel, it must follow the VCV rule outlined earlier.

Only the following consonants may begin a word:

- **k**, **s**, **t**, **n**, **h**, **m**, **r**, **l**

**Special Case**:  
The consonant **v** is **only allowed at the start of a word in the cluster** **vr** (e.g. *vroka*).

### 3.2 Word-Final Rules

Words in Kaisoze **must end in a vowel**, with **one exception**: the consonant **j** is permitted in final position.

> ✅ *maki*, *leno*, *taj*  
> ❌ *lant*, *sark*, *trom*

| Feature                     | Rule                                                                 |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Core Syllable Structure     | <Tooltip word="CV">CV</Tooltip>; optionally VCV at word start        |
| Allowed Clusters            | Only **tr** and **kr**, at word start only                          |
| Allowed Diphthongs          | ai, ei, ia, ui — allowed anywhere in place of a vowel               |
| Initial Consonants          | k, s, t, n, h, m, r, l; **v** only in **vr**                         |
| Final Sound Constraints     | Must end in vowel, **except** when ending in **j**                  |

By enforcing a limited but expressive set of phonotactic rules, Kaisoze maintains a consistent sound profile while allowing for some flexibility through controlled exceptions.
