# Nouns in Kaisoze

In language, **nouns** are words that represent people, places, things, or ideas. In Kaisoze, nouns are rich in form and function, showing **<Tooltip word="Definiteness">definiteness</Tooltip>**, **<Tooltip word="Number">number</Tooltip>**, and **<Tooltip word="Case">case</Tooltip>**. These features determine how a noun behaves in a sentence and how it relates to other words.

---

## 1. Definiteness

A noun in Kaisoze can appear in two forms:

| Form           | Meaning         | Example             |
|----------------|------------------|---------------------|
| Regular        | General concept  | `melisa` – "girl"   |
| Definitive     | Specific entity  | `melisa**ni**` – "the girl" |

The **definitive form** is created by adding the suffix **`-ni`** (**bolded in examples**).

> **Examples**  
> - *Iru melisa* – "I am a girl"  
> - *Melisa**ni** rane mia* – "The girl wants a cat"

**Note:** Only nouns in the **<Tooltip word="Nominative">nominative</Tooltip> case** can take the **definitive suffix**.

---

## 2. Number

Kaisoze distinguishes between **singular** and **plural** nouns.

- Singular: base form  
- Plural: marked with the **preposition `za`** before the noun

| Form     | Meaning   | Example         |
|----------|-----------|-----------------|
| Singular | One       | `mia` – "cat"   |
| Plural   | More than one | `za mia` – "cats" |

> **Example**: *Melisa**ni** rane za mia* – "The girl wants (the) cats"

---

## 3. Cases

Kaisoze uses cases to show how nouns function in sentences. Here's an overview:

| Case         | Suffix    | Function                                  |
|--------------|-----------|-------------------------------------------|
| Nominative   | *(none)*  | Subject of a sentence                     |
| Accusative   | **-ki**   | Direct object of a verb                   |
| Genitive     | **-do**   | Possession                                |
| Instrumental | **-gi**   | Tool or companion ("with")                |
| Locative     | **-no**   | Location ("at", "in")                     |

---

### 3.1 Nominative Case

The **nominative** case is the base form of the noun and is used for the **subject** of a sentence. No suffix is used.

> **Examples**  
> - *Melisani hisu.* – "The girl walks."  
> - *Melisa**ni** rane mia.* – "The girl wants a cat."

Only **nominative** nouns can take the **definitive suffix** **`-ni`**.

---

### 3.2 Accusative Case

The **accusative** case marks the **direct object**—the thing being acted upon. It is formed with the suffix **`-ki`**.

> **Examples**  
> - *Melisa rane mia**ki**.* – "The girl wants the cat."  

Note: **Accusative nouns cannot take the definitive suffix**, since their grammatical role is already marked. Also we can skip the acusative case sometimes but I will detail this later in the syntax section.

---

### 3.3 Genitive Case

The **genitive** case shows **possession** and uses the suffix **`-do`**.

Kaisoze allows two patterns:

#### Pattern 1: Possessor Before Possessed

> **Structure**: `Possessor -do + Possessed`  
> **Example**: *Melisa**do** mia* – "The girl's cat"

#### Pattern 2: Possessor After Possessed

> **Structure**: Possessed **-ni** + Possessor **-do**
> **Example**: *Mia**ni** melisa**do*** – "The cat is the girl's"

> This structure emphasizes the possessed item by making it **definite**.

---

### 3.4 Instrumental Case

The **instrumental** case shows **means** or **accompaniment** and is formed with the suffix **`-gi`**.

> Think of it like “with” in English.

> **Examples**  
> - *Hisuru melisu**gi**.* – "I walk with the boy."  
> - *Melisa**ni** vure mesa**gi*** – "The boy talks with the woman."  
> - *Melisu hena onali**gi**.* – "The boy writes with the pen."

---

### 3.5 Locative Case

The **locative** case shows **location**, using the suffix **`-no`**. It's similar to saying "at" or "in" in English.

> **Examples**  
> - *Iru mero**no**.* – "I am at my friend’s (place)."  
> - *Melisa**ni** ire imaso**no**.* – "The girl is at school."  
> - *Melisa**ni** imaso**no**.* – (Optional “is”) "The girl (is) at school."
